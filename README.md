## üöÄ Core VLSI Projects

I am currently developing a portfolio of foundational RTL design projects in Verilog. These projects demonstrate my understanding of core digital design principles and are the first step in my journey toward building complex verification testbenches.

| Project | Description | Skills Demonstrated | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8-bit ALU** | A combinational logic project that performs key arithmetic and logical operations, serving as the core of a processor. | Verilog, RTL Design, Combinational Logic | ‚è≥ In Progress |
| **Traffic Light Controller** | A sequential logic project implementing a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage traffic flow based on state transitions. | Verilog, RTL Design, Sequential Logic | ‚è≥ In Progress |
| **FIFO Buffer** | A First-In, First-Out (FIFO) memory buffer that manages read/write pointers and status flags (full/empty). | Verilog, RTL Design, Memory Design | ‚è≥ In Progress |
